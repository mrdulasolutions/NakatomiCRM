# Nakatomi Roadmap

> **See also:** [AgentLab.md](./AgentLab.md) — recipes for real-world agent
> deployments on Nakatomi (solo SDR, swarms, harness setups, connector chains).
> The roadmap is *what we're building*; AgentLab is *how you'd use it*.

Nakatomi is a headless, agent-native CRM. This roadmap is organized into phases. Each
item has a status: `[ ]` todo, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` shipped. File references are
clickable paths; bullets that name an adapter/connector have a short design note.

Skip to: [v1 Core](#v1--core-crm-shipped), [v1.1 Repo](#v11--repo-hygiene--agent-surface-in-progress),
[v1.2 Install](#v12--install-surface), [v1.3 Memory](#v13--agentic-memory-interop),
[v1.4 Ingest](#v14--ingest), [v1.5 Dashboard](#v15--local-audit-dashboard),
[v2 Later](#v2--later).

## v1 — Core CRM (shipped)

- [x] FastAPI + Postgres + Alembic + Dockerfile + `railway.toml`
- [x] Multi-tenant workspaces; user JWT and per-workspace API keys
- [x] Contacts, Companies, Pipelines/Stages, Deals, Activities, Notes, Tasks
- [x] Relationship graph (typed edges + BFS `/relationships/neighbors`)
- [x] Append-only timeline (`/timeline`)
- [x] HMAC-signed webhooks with retry + delivery log
- [x] Files (pluggable `local` / `s3` backend)
- [x] Soft delete, cursor pagination, bulk upsert, idempotency scaffolding
- [x] Self-describing `/schema` manifest
- [x] MCP server over streamable HTTP at `/mcp` with curated agent tools
- [x] Seed script (`scripts/seed.py`)

## v1.1 — Repo hygiene & agent surface (in progress)

- [x] `ROADMAP.md`
- [x] `LICENSE` (MIT)
- [x] `README.md` — quickstart, deploy, auth, MCP, REST
- [x] `AUTHORS.md`, `CONTRIBUTORS.md`
- [x] `SECURITY.md` — disclosure policy
- [x] `ETHOS.md` — project values
- [x] `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md`
- [x] `llms.txt` — LLM-discoverable doc index (served at `/llms.txt`)
- [x] `/.well-known/agent.json` — A2A agent card (served)
- [x] `docs/SKILLS.md` — how agents install Nakatomi as a skill

- [x] OpenAPI hardening — tag metadata (20 tags with one-line descriptions), app
      contact/license/description, RFC 9457 Problem Details error responses
      (with legacy `error` field kept for pre-v0.2 clients). Per-route
      response examples still a stretch follow-up.
- [ ] Tests: pytest + httpx against an ephemeral Postgres
- [ ] Ruff + mypy configured in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] CI: GitHub Actions for lint/test + build/push Docker image

## v1.2 — Install surface

- [x] `docker-compose.yml` — Postgres + app + volume, one `docker compose up`
- [x] `install.sh` — detects Docker or Python; bootstraps a local workspace + key
- [x] Railway one-click template button in `README.md`
  - Generic button shipped (`railway.com/new/template?template=<repo>`).
    Swap to a published share code once Matt clicks *Publish as Template*
    on the live deployment — full playbook in
    [docs/RAILWAY_TEMPLATE.md](./docs/RAILWAY_TEMPLATE.md).
- [ ] Fly.io / Render deploy recipes (stretch)
- [ ] Homebrew tap (stretch) — `brew install nakatomi` wrapping the install script
- [ ] PyPI distribution of an `nakatomi` CLI (stretch) — `nakatomi up`, `nakatomi seed`, `nakatomi dashboard`

## v1.3 — Agentic memory interop

**Thesis:** we don't implement semantic memory. Agents already have that. Nakatomi
becomes the **structured source of truth** (people, companies, deals, tasks) and
delegates unstructured recall to external memory systems. Links are bidirectional:
a CRM mutation can write/trigger a memory; a memory write can traceback to a CRM
entity and (optionally) trigger a CRM action.

- [x] `MemoryLink` table — polymorphic: (crm_entity_type, crm_entity_id) ↔ (connector, external_id)
- [x] `MemoryConnector` abstract interface — `store_event`, `recall`, `link`
- [x] Config via env: `MEMORY_CONNECTORS=docdeploy,supermemory` + per-adapter creds
- [x] Adapter stubs:
  - `docdeploy` — x402 pay-per-call memory (https://www.docdeploy.io)
  - `supermemory` — REST add/search (https://supermemory.ai)
  - `gbrain` — stub wired; MCP-first, needs `_call_tool` filled in for your deployment (https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain)
  - `memcastle` — TODO: point at docs & implement
- [x] `POST /memory/recall` — fan out across configured connectors, merge results
- [x] `POST /memory/link` — explicitly cross-link a CRM entity and an external memory id
- [x] `POST /memory/webhook/{connector}` — inbound: memory system pushed a write → optionally mutate CRM
- [x] Wire `services/events.emit()` to call `store_event` on enabled connectors
- [ ] Per-workspace connector config (currently global via env)
- [ ] Conflict policy surface — what to do when an inbound memory write contradicts a CRM field
- [ ] "Trace" API — `GET /memory/trace/{entity_type}/{entity_id}` returns all known memory refs and their provenance
- [x] MCP tools: `memory_list_connectors`, `memory_recall`, `memory_link`, `memory_trace`

## v1.4 — Ingest

**Thesis:** agents will feed Nakatomi from whatever source they're plumbed into
(Apollo, HubSpot, Gmail, PDFs, pasted text). Nakatomi normalizes, dedupes, and lands
clean records. Standardization happens inside Nakatomi so every agent sees the same
shape.

- [x] `POST /ingest` — accepts `{source, format, payload}` and returns diagnostics + created ids
- [x] MCP tool `ingest` — same contract as REST, callable by agents natively
- [x] Adapters scaffold:
  - `csv` — header inference + column map hints
  - `vcard` — parse contacts
  - `json` — generic JSON with a mapping spec
  - `text` — LLM-friendly "note + entity-mention" split (agent does extraction; we standardize)
- [x] Standardization pipeline: lowercase email, E.164 phone, URL canonicalization, whitespace trim, tag dedup
- [x] Fuzzy duplicate detection (`GET /contacts/duplicates` — pg_trgm-based;
      strategies: exact email, similar name + same company, same last name +
      similar first name; feeds into `/contacts/merge`)
- [ ] Dry-run mode (`?dry_run=true`) — returns what *would* change
- [ ] Attachment ingest — accept file + mapping spec, produce `File` records + entity links
- [ ] Webhook ingest — accept an inbound webhook from a connector, route to the right adapter

## v1.5 — Local audit dashboard

**Thesis:** the dashboard is a read-only audit surface. It is NOT a product UI. Its
job: let a human confirm at a glance what the agents did last night.

- [x] Minimal FastAPI-served HTML dashboard at `/dashboard` (disabled by default)
- [x] Claude skill: saying "nakatomi dashboard" spins up the stack locally (docker compose) and opens Chrome at `http://localhost:8000/dashboard`
- [ ] Views:
  - [x] Timeline stream (workspace-wide)
  - [x] Recent contacts / companies / deals
  - [x] Deal pipeline kanban (read-only; tab on /dashboard with columns per stage, totals per column, won/lost coloring)
  - [x] Webhook delivery log (Webhooks tab on /dashboard; subscriber list with health badges, click-to-expand delivery rows with status/attempts/http-code/error/response body, status filter)
  - [x] Memory link inspector (Memory tab on /dashboard; `GET /memory/links` backend with connector / entity_type / entity_id filters and cursor pagination)
  - [ ] Audit log search
- [ ] Auth: local-only by default (binds to 127.0.0.1); short-lived session cookie from API key
- [ ] Dark mode + keyboard nav

## v2 — Later

- [x] Custom fields v1 (named fields per entity type, declared in
      `custom_field_definitions`; values still in `data` JSONB; no runtime
      validation yet — agents can see the schema via `GET /custom-fields`)
- [ ] Saved views / queries
- [x] Durable webhook retry (worker + queue — in-process, SKIP LOCKED, backoff schedule, marks dead after max retries)
- [x] Rate limiting per API key (fixed 60s window, per-key override, Retry-After header on 429)
- [x] Streaming file upload + download (chunked SHA at upload, StreamingResponse on download, Storage.open() + iter_chunks helper on the interface)
- [ ] pgvector (optional) for workspaces that prefer server-side semantic search
- [x] Row-level audit diffs (field-level before/after on every PATCH — stored in the timeline event's `changes` payload; captured via SQLAlchemy session history before flush)
- [x] Merge: "resolve duplicate contacts" flow (`POST /contacts/merge` with
      dry_run + field_preferences; rewrites deal/note/task/activity/file/
      relationship/memory_link FKs from loser → winner; emits `contact.merged`
      with the full field diff and rewrite counts)
- [ ] SSO (Google / GitHub) for human logins
- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing
- [x] Export: full workspace dump as a single JSON doc (`GET /export`); round-trip
      re-import via `POST /import` with merge-mode upsert, id-translation for
      polymorphic refs, and `dry_run`. File bytes are a v2 extension (tarball).
- [ ] Import from legacy CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Attio) — one-shot migrations

## Deploy hardening (from v0.1.1's first-deploy lessons)

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT_LESSONS.md`](./docs/DEPLOYMENT_LESSONS.md) for the
eleven issues we hit on the first Railway deploy. These are follow-ups
that turn lessons into guardrails:

- [ ] Add a test that runs `alembic upgrade head` against a clean DB so
      migration-ordering bugs fail in CI, not in prod.
- [ ] Retrofit migration 0001 to use explicit `op.create_table` calls
      instead of `Base.metadata.create_all` (the shortcut that started
      the fresh-install cascade).
- [ ] CI step that loads `requirements.txt` in a clean venv and resolves
      transitive deps, catching mcp↔pydantic-style conflicts before
      push.
- [ ] Comment top-level deps in `requirements.txt` with the reason for
      each pin.
- [x] Railway deploy button shipped in README; publishing the share
      code via the Railway dashboard is a one-time manual click
      (playbook: [docs/RAILWAY_TEMPLATE.md](./docs/RAILWAY_TEMPLATE.md)).
- [ ] A GitHub Issue template "Deploy to new cloud target" that links
      the checklist.

## AgentLab expansion

[AgentLab.md](./AgentLab.md) is a living document. These are patterns we want
to add (as real, tested recipes — not hand-waving):

- [ ] **Multi-tenant swarm manager** — one control-plane agent that mints
      per-task API keys, monitors rate-limit pressure, rotates keys.
- [ ] **Replay-on-failure** — a pattern where the durable webhook queue feeds a
      "recovery agent" that reconciles CRM state with downstream systems after
      an outage.
- [ ] **Territory handoff agent** — cross-region transfers with complete
      history preservation (see §8 skeleton).
- [ ] **Compliance auditor** — reads the audit log, flags agents that bypass
      soft-delete, don't set `external_id`, or mutate without reading the
      timeline first. Useful when the swarm has grown beyond what one human
      can review by hand.
- [ ] **Benchmark harness** — scripts that drive a test workspace through
      synthetic load (5 SDR agents, 200 leads/min) so operators can size
      Postgres + pick a rate-limit budget before production.
- [ ] **Cross-harness portability** — write the same skill in Claude Code,
      Claude Agent SDK, Cursor, and ChatGPT Action form; measure which host
      does which thing well.
- [ ] **Post-mortem agent** — every Monday, reads last week's timeline, clusters
      failed deals by root cause, writes a note on each, creates tasks.
- [ ] **"Time-travel" agent** — reconstructs the state of a deal as of any
      timestamp using the timeline event stream; helps a human reviewer
      disagree precisely with a past agent decision.
- [ ] **GTM pipeline optimizer** — reads stage conversion rates from the
      timeline, suggests pipeline re-shapes, writes a proposal note a
      human approves or declines.
- [ ] **Data hygiene agent patterns** — dedupe by fuzzy name+company, merge
      contacts across workspaces, prune stale relationships.

PRs welcome. The goal is to cover the agent harnesses, the verticals, and
the edge cases — not to collect generic demos.

## Non-goals (we explicitly won't build these)

- Email sending / email sync — agents already do this (Gmail / Hostinger / Outlook MCP)
- Calendar — agents have Google Calendar MCP
- Marketing automation / drip campaigns — agents compose sequences; we store them as activities
- Forms / landing pages — outside the agent workflow
- Built-in semantic search — delegated to memory connectors
- Rich GUI product — dashboard is audit-only; rich UIs are someone else's product on top of our API
